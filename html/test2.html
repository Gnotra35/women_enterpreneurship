                <h2>1. Celebrating Women Empowerment: Insights from the First State Workshop on Women Entrepreneurship Platform (WEP) in Goa (AIRWE)</h2>
                <blockquote>ਸੋ ਕਿਉ ਮੰਦਾ ਆਖੀਐ ਜਿਤੁ ਜੰਮਹਿ ਰਾਜਾਨ ॥</blockquote>
                <p>So why call her bad? From her, kings are born. (SGGS Ang 473)</p>
                <p>
                    It was a humbling experience at the First state workshop under the Women Entrepreneurship Platform (WEP), a transformative event organized by NITI Aayog, Govt. of India, and the Goa State Government.
                    This inspiring gathering took place on October 3, 2023, at the scenic CSIR-National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), Dona Paula, Goa, and brought together remarkable minds dedicated to empowering women entrepreneurs.
                    The significance of women's entrepreneurship, underscoring the crucial role of mentorship in this journey was explored.
                    The passion and deep sense of purpose was emphasized and the fundamental need for education forms the edifice upon which women can build their entrepreneurial dreams. Akal Institute of Rural Empowerment, a commendable initiative, is taking giant strides in educating and empowering women across five states in rural North India.
                    The event was graced by NITI Aayog Chairman Mr. B.V.R Subramanyam and the Hon’ble Chief Minister of Goa, Dr. Pramod Sawant, who wholeheartedly supported the cause of nurturing women in business.
