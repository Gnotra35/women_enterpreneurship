      <h2>About AIRWE</h2>
      <p>AIRWE (Akal Institute of Rural Women Empowerment) is a residential program sponsored by The Kalgidhar Trust, dedicated to delivering high-quality education to disadvantaged young 
         women from remote regions of North India. This initiative offers challenged girls from rural families who face obstacles in pursuing further education, free Gurmat Vidya education 
         primarily due to financial constraints. The Trust firmly believes in the transformative power of education, not only improving the lives of these young women but also uplifting their 
         future generations.AIRWE programs have been pivotal in introducing a substantial number of first-generation students (those being the first in their households to receive education) 
         to the world of learning, thereby catalyzing progress for their entire families and communities. This program combines contemporary scientific education with spiritual enrichment, 
         aiming to empower young women. The duration of the program spans from 4 to 8 years, depending on the studentâ€™s prior educational background at the time of admission. The women enrolled 
         in this project receive education through the National Institute of Open Learning (NIOS board) and Eternal University (UGC approved). Since its establishment in the late 1990s, AIRWE
         has positively impacted the lives of over 1000 girl students in India. Upon completing their education, these young women become qualified to work as educators or administrators in Akal
         Academy schools or pursue further education abroad. The center also provides essential amenities such as free accommodation, meals, healthcare, and other support services throughout the program.
